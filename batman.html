							 Dark Knight. Caped Crusader. World’s Greatest Detective. 
							Whatever you know him as, wherever you know him from—the 
							blockbuster movies, TV shows, video games, cartoons, or 
							millions of comics—Batman is proof you don’t need superpowers 
							to be a superhero… and the poster boy for what a bad childhood 
							can do to you.
							<br>
							<br>
							Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world’s greatest weapon against crime—the Batman.

Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons. Batman is the most feared superhero of all, because he’s pushed himself to the absolute pinnacle of human achievement. He’s a brilliant detective who’s mastered fighting techniques the world’s barely heard of. An Olympic-caliber athlete with a plan for every occasion, Batman’s seemingly always five steps ahead of his foes. But in his crusade against injustice, two questions always loom: How far will he go to protect the innocent, and will he sacrifice his humanity along the way?
